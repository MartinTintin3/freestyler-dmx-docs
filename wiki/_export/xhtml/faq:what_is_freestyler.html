FreeStyler<br/>

Fixture Creator<br/>

FreeStandalone<br/>

Art-Net to DMX<br/>

<br/>

Additional programs created by users.<br/>

See the list bellow <a href="./faq:what_is_freestyler.html#additional_programs_created_by_the_users" title="faq:what_is_freestyler ↵" class="wikilink1">Additional programs</a><br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<strong>FreeStyler</strong><br/>

FreeStyler is the main program where light can be set, settings recorded and playedback.<br/>

This gives the possibility to have live control over the light but also to make pre programmed scenes / settings.<br/>

The preprogrammed settings can consist of one or more scenes that can be freely programmed and this gives the possibility to create fixed scenes for theater or dynamic shifting scenes / light that can be used for concerts or disco.<br/>

The scenes are saved in sequences which are attached to a cue and the cue is then used to playback the sequences.<br/>

An example could be a shifting light (chaser). The lights that are “on” and “off” are set one by one and added to a sequence. Each step in the sequence represent shift in which light that are “on” and which are “off”.<br/>

When the sequence is playedback in a cue this gives a shifting light.
<br/>

FreeStyler has a lot of functionality to make an easy programming of the light and to manipulate the setting so the light behave like wanted even in tricky situations.<br/>

Additional it has the possibility to use external control input such as fader panels via midi interface or input from touch screens.<br/>

From users there are created aps for remote control with mac or android.<br/>

<br/>

<strong>Fixture Creator.</strong><br/>

<br/>

Fixture Creator is a program used to create personalities, here called fixtures, that link FreeStyler functions and the DMX value send to the light fixture together.<br/>

An example could be a light fixture that has a red color on color wheel.<br/>

The color is controlled on channel 5 with a DMX value 30.<br/>

In Fixture Creator this can be configured so the color wheel function is attached to channel 5.<br/>

Additional an icon here “red” can be selected and a value, here 30 can be linked together.<br/>

This will, when this fixture is used in FreeStyler, give a red icon in the color wheel panel and when the red icon is pressed FreeStyler know that it has to send the value 30 on the fixtures channel 5.<br/>

There by the linking.<br/>

All fixture control functions in FreeStyler are present and can be configured in Fixture Creator.<br/>

Have a look on the wiki. There are plenty examples and information.<br/>

<br/>

<strong>Art-Net to DMX</strong><br/>

Art-Net to DMX is a small client program that are placed on a remote PC.<br/>

The remote PC are connected to the light fixture via a DMX dongle and to the Ethernet.<br/>

This setup enables FreeStyler to control the remote PC and there by the light connected to the remote PC via Ethernet.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<strong>FreeStandalone.</strong><br/>

FreeStandalone is a small program that works with some special DMX interfaces that has a build-in memory. The memory of these interfaces can hold a number of scenes which can be controlled / selected with the “FreeStandalone”.<br/>

The scenes are recorded and uploaded to the memory with Sequence Editor.<br/>

It is statics scenes which means not a sequence with multiple scenes.<br/>
