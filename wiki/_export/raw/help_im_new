====== Help! I'm new, Where do I start? ======
First of all Welcome to the FreeStyler DMX wiki.\\
\\
I'm going to show you some Links, in the order you should read them.\\
For a start it is good to know how to Select your DMX device, Patching Fixtures and Creating your own sequences and knowing how to play them back.\\
\\
==== The Basics ====
1. Selecting the proper Interface this should be "Virtual interface" for 3d view or your own device.\\

There is One page that answers almost all your questions, so take a look.\\

\\
==== Advanced Programming ==== 
\\
with these tools you can make all kinds of effects really easily.\\

==== Advanced Playback ====
\\
there are 4 different way's you can play back your sequences, but you can only use one system at a time.\\
\\
1. Cue window (Basic)\\
\\
[[playback:cue:playback_sequence | Playback a Sequence]]\\
\\
2. Time code (start a sequence on Time HH:MM:SS)\\
\\
[[playback:time_code|Timecode]]\\
\\
3. Cuelist buttons (The cuelist buttons are used to start a complete cue at once)\\
\\
\\
4. Submaster (here you can Drag cue files to a select boxes, for more control of the fixtures)\\
\\
[[playback:submasters:submaster_config|Submaster]]\\
\\
X. Overide buttons (you can always use this, to start the First step of a sequence. and more)\\
