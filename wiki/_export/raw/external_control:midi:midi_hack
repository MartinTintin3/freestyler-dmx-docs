====== Midi hack ======

okay, I got it working like this:
  * when I press "button 1" on my nanokontrol, I can control seq speed 1-5 on encoder 1-5 and submaster 1-5 on fader and the two buttons on 1-5
  * when I press "button 2" on my nanokontrol, I can control seq speed 6-10 on encoder 1-5 and submaster 1-5 on fader and the two buttons on 1-5
  * when I press "button 3" on my nanokontrol, I can control seq speed 11-15 on encoder 1-5 and submaster 1-5 on fader and the two buttons on 1-5
  * when I press "button 4" on my nanokontrol, I can control seq speed 16-20 on encoder 1-5 and submaster 1-5 on fader and the two buttons on 1-5

Just like we want it :D but it was really complex to get it to work and it takes a bit of explanation to tell you guys how I did it,

You need to use the program change note. if MIDI-OX recieves this, it can call different mappings. this way you can map the encoders to match the submaster page.

unfortunately the nanocontrol can't send out program change notes, but the BCF can, so it is much easier to set it up on that controller.

-------
READ THIS IF YOU USE A NANOKONTROL OR ANY OTHER MIDI CONTROLLER WHICH CAN'T SEND OUT PROGRAM CHANGE NOTES:: IF IT CAN (like the BCF2000) SKIP THIS.

If you use the Korg nanokontrol you have to open an extra MIDI-OX where the MIDI from the naonkontrol enters before the second MIDI-OX. remember to set both MIDI-OX programs up so that the signal goes through these two before it enters FS.
Here you have to make one mapping:
submaster page buttons 1-4 (value 1) when the value2 is 127--> set it to send out program change notes 1-4
Make sure you set a checkmark at "Pass Original Value on (Clone)".

FOR ALL MIDI CONTROLLERS:

1) with the BCedit program you have to change the 4 buttons (you cant use next and prev submaster page for this trick) to send out program change 1-4.
2) in MIDI-OX you have to make 4 filters with 1-2 mappings each

Filter 1
Mapping 1:
program change 1-4 --> control change 1-4

Lets save the filter as "filter 1" for this tutorial

Filter 2
Mapping 1:
program change 1-4 --> control change 1-4
Mapping 2:
The control change numbers for the 5 encoders/fader you want to use as speed (lets say number 1-5 to simplify this tutorial) --> set the control change number to 6-10

Save the filter as "filter 2"

Filter 3
Mapping 1:
program change 1-4 --> control change 1-4
Mapping 2:
The control change numbers for the 5 encoders/fader you want to use as speed (lets say number 1-5 to simplify this tutorial) --> set the control change number to 11-15

Save the filter as "filter 3"

Filter 4
Mapping 1:
program change 1-4 --> control change 1-4
Mapping 2:
The control change numbers for the 5 encoders/fader you want to use as speed (lets say number 1-5 to simplify this tutorial) --> set the control change number to 16-20

Save the filter as "filter 4"

3) go to "Options --> patch mapping" in MIDI-OX main window
4) press assign and find the filter files you have saved:
number 1: Filter 1
number 2: Filter 2
number 3: Filter 3
number 4: Filter 4

now it should work
