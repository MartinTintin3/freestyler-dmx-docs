Rather simple question:<br><br>Why do the Bezier shapes stop moving when using a cue? Yes I do understand that when the cue would contain the pan and tilt of the fixture that is using the Bezier shape. But I really would like to use the Bezier shapes when playing other non Bezier shape related cues.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.freestylersupport.com/fsforum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=172">magic</a> — April 25th, 2024, 7:43 pm — Replies 0 — Views 23</p><hr />

Hi, I'm testing something out, I have 4 RGB PARs 6 channels each. Through the FX section in Sequence creator I created SINE that goes through red channel (basically dimming up and down) and I did this for green and blue as well. Added all to cue and inserted it to the submaster one. When I play one of those sequences and click on GO, it starts the next one but it looks like it leaves the previous one ON but it freezes. Can you help me please with that?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.freestylersupport.com/fsforum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=30567">lightguy1234</a> — February 3rd, 2024, 6:07 pm — Replies 3 — Views 63664</p><hr />

I am a NOOB but I am usually good about figuring things out and searching the web for answers. But I am honestly stumped with what seems like it should be simple, so I am here asking you all for some help.<br><br>All I am trying to do is create a sequence that will play a slow fade up, lets say red, on one single light. So with the light off initially, I want to trigger the sequence which will fade the light slowly up from off to fully on over 10 seconds.<br><br>I have created a dozen sequences trying to do this, and have watched lots of videos, but none of them show how to accomplish this. If someone is able to provide step-by-step directions on how to accomplish this I would be forever grateful.

Hello, long time user of the software so very familiar with how to use. I currently have 20 scenes involving multiple fixtures which means editing any scene with a bunch of steps is very time consuming. Some of these scenes use the same values for a given fixture. My question is if there is some quick way to copy a fixtures values in a scene for all steps to a different existing scene for all steps?<br><br>Example: Fixture 1 is programmed with all steps in scene A. How can I copy all of the fixture values for fixture 1 in all steps of scene A to all steps of scene B?<br><br>Currently I have to go into a scene, copy the values for a fixture for that step, open the other scene, and then paste those fixture values into the correct step of that scene and repeat.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.freestylersupport.com/fsforum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17152">jtlayne</a> — January 3rd, 2024, 5:22 pm — Replies 3 — Views 1849</p><hr />
